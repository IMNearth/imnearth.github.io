I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the School of Data Science, Fudan University. My supervisor are Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjLDxxgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jianqing Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TaF4L4EAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I got my Bachelor’s degree from Fudan University majoring in data science. I am currently visiting the [V3ALab](https://v3alab.github.io/) at Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), advised by Prof. [Qi Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aKXe1FEAAAAJ&hl=en). 


My research interests are to advance multimodal and embodied intelligence, by utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can perceive, reason, and act in rich, interactive environments. Currently, I have explored the following topics:

* **Vision-Language Navigation and GUI Navigation**: Curriculum Learning ([NeurIPS'21](https://github.com/IMNearth/Curriculum-Learning-For-VLN)), Unit-grained Hybrid Learning ([arXiv'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08016)), Contrastive Learning ([COLING'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.411/)) for VLN. Chain-of-Action Thought ([EMNLP'24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.702/)), Multi-Screen Understanding ([EMNLP'25](https://uihawk.github.io/)) for GUI Nav.

* **Large-scale Pretraining and Post-Training for MLLMs**: Grounding-oriented Pre-training ([arXiv'24](https://github.com/yuyq96/TextHawk)), Large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning ([EMNLP'25](https://uihawk.github.io/)), Visually Grounded Reasoning ([NAACL'25](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.192/)) and Adaptive Visual Reasoning ([arXiv'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22746)).


* **Benchmarking of Multimodal & Embodied Models**: Unified reformulation of multimodal tasks ([ACM MM'2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3664647.3681529)), Agent-based Efficient Benchmarking ([arXiv'25](https://github.com/IMNearth/AutoJudger)) for MLLMs, Fundamental Abilities Evaluation of GUI Agents ([EMNLP'25](https://uihawk.github.io/)). 


I expect to graduate in September 2026 and am currently seeking job and internship opportunities.
