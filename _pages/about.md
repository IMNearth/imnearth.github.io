I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the School of Data Science, Fudan University. My supervisor are Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjLDxxgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jianqing Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TaF4L4EAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I got my Bachelor’s degree from Fudan University majoring in data science. I am currently visiting the [V3ALab](https://v3alab.github.io/) at Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), advised by Prof. [Qi Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aKXe1FEAAAAJ&hl=en). 


My research interests are to advance multimodal and embodied intelligence, by utilizing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can perceive, reason, and act in rich, interactive environments. Currently, I have explored the following topics:

* Benchmarking of Multimodal & Embodied Models: Unified reformulation of multimodal tasks ([ACM MM'2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3664647.3681529)), Agent-based Efficient Benchmarking ([ArXiv](https://github.com/IMNearth/AutoJudger)) for MLLMs; Fundamental Abilities Evaluation of GUI Agents ([EMNLP'25](https://uihawk.github.io/)). 

* Large-scale Pretraining and Post-Training for MLLMs:  






I expect to graduate in September 2026 and am currently seeking job and internship opportunities.
